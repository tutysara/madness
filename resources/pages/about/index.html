    I don't really like talking about myself, I find it better to ask
    the <a href="http://ddg.gg/">Great Duck</a> what it knows about
    <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Gergely+Nagy+%2Balgernon&kl=hu-hu">me</a>.
    Quite a lot, actually: I have my dirty fingerprints on all kinds
    of strange stuff.
  </p>

  <p>
    But they all have one thing in common:
    they're <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html">free
    software</a>. Ever since I first installed GNU/Linux, back in
    1998, I've been a fan of free software, regardless of its license
    (though, for my own works, I prefer
    the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html">GPL</a>).
  </p>

  <p>
    But alas, you wanted to know who I am, since you visited this
    page. Didn't you?
  </p>

  <p>
    Allright! If
    the <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Gergely+Nagy+%2Balgernon&kl=hu-hu">Great
    Duck</a> wasn't telling enough, know that I am a hacker, or a tiny
    mouse behind the keyboard. Offline, I'm known as Gergely Nagy (but
    please, unless you're hungarian, don't try to pronounce my name;
    if we ever meet, stick with algernon, thank you), and I work as a
    software engineer, as a member
    of <a href="http://www.balabit.com/">BalaBit</a>'s support team.
