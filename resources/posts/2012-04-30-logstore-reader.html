  <p>
    Early this year <a href="http://www.balabit.com/">BalaBit</a> was
    considering to open up its LogStore file format, a format used by
    the premium edition
    of <a href="http://www.balabit.com/network-security/syslog-ng">syslog-ng</a>
    that supports compression, encryption, secure timestamping and a
    lot of other goodies.
  </p>

  <p>
    To help further the cause of opening the format, I went ahead and
    started to implement an API to read it (and at the same time,
    document it too, to some extent). As of a few days ago, the
    library is avaiable
    on <a href="https://github.com/algernon/balabit.logstore">github</a>
    - although not quite complete yet, but open nevertheless!

  <p>
    This library is not only my
    first <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> code I release,
    but it is also the first software I wrote in a functional language
    (though, the library relies heavily on Java IO, and keeps state in
    a thread-unsafe way, at least for now). For this reason, I'm both
    proud and nervous. Proud, because it is always a great feeling to
    release code, especially in a language one hasn't worked with
    before, doubly so if the language is as amazing
    as <a href="http://clojure.org/">Clojure</a> is. Nervous, because
    working in a new language often results in non-idiomatic code;
    code that is either inefficient, or just crude or even plain old
    ugly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Nevertheless, the code is available from now on, for everyone to
    look at, and see how I write in a language I'm still learning. The
    code is far from complete, and even though I strived
    to <a href="http://algernon.github.com/balabit.logstore/">document
    it throughly</a>, the current version is an early alpha-quality at
    best.
  </p>

  <p>
    The end goal is to have an API that is straightforward and easy to
    use, so much so that writing a simple program that simply dumps the
    contents of a LogStore as easy as this:
  </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-clj">(ns logcat
  (:require [balabit.logstore :as logstore]))

(defun- lgs-print-msgs [record-index]
  "Prints all the messages within any given record."

  (dorun (map println (:messages (logstore/nth-record record-index)))))

(logstore/with-file "/path/to/messages.store"
  (let [indexed-records (zipmap (range (count (logstore/records))) (logstore/records))
        chunk-records (keys (filter #(= :chunk (type (val %))) indexed-records))]
    (dorun (map lgs-print-msgs chunk-records))))</pre>

  <p>
    This should work for all LogStores, even if they're compressed and
    serialized, even if they're encrypted (though, in that case, we
    will need to specify a decryption key).
  </p>

  <p>
    But alas, it is not the library I wanted to talk about - the
    library and its goals
    are <a href="http://algernon.github.com/balabit.logstore/">documented</a>
    throughly, but the language and the fun things I could do with it
    while developing the library.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, function composition and multimethods allow me to write
    code like this:
  </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-clj">(defn- chunk-decode
  "Does everything neccessary to turn the raw message data into
  something more comprehensible, something easier to work with.

  This is done by composing all of the multi-methods above."
  [header msgcnt data data-size]
  ((comp (partial chunk-data-deserialize header)
         (partial chunk-decompress header data-size))
   data))</pre>

  <p>
    Depending on the chunk flags, a chunk can be either compressed or
    not, or serialized or not, and any combination of this two. The
    above function handles them all, thanks to
    multi-methods. Composing them this way fills me with joy, it is
    powerful, yet easy to understand.
  </p>

  <p>
    Multi-methods allow me to grab a header, and depending on their
    value, implement - for example - deserialization based on the
    header's contents, and the language will dispatch it to the
    appropriate method. This is very, very convenient, and has made my
    life in this project and in others a whole lot easier.
  </p>

  <p>
    Macros are another thing that makes Clojure (and LISPs in general)
    very attractive to me. The entire <tt>balabit.logstore</tt>
    namespace is nothing else than a collection of convenience
    macros. Ever since I was exposed to them, I miss them dearly in
    other languages I have to code in.
  </p>

  <p>
    But apart from language features, the Clojure ecosystem is also
    very mature and powerful. To name a few examples,
    the <a href="https://github.com/marick/Midje">midje</a> testing
    system,
    the <a href="https://github.com/fogus/marginalia">marginalia</a>
    documentation system are all things I find very hard to live
    without when not working with Clojure.
  </p>

  <p>
    The community is yet another thing that keeps me interested in the
    language: <a href="http://planet.clojure.in/">Planet Clojure</a>
    is always full of good reads, and not always strictly
    Clojure-related.
  </p>

  <p>
    And to wrap it up, lets get back to the library! Development from
    now on will be done
    in <a href="https://github.com/algernon/balabit.logstore">public</a>,
    and a formal description of the LogStore format will follow soon,
    together with the implementation of missing features from the
    library.
  </p>

  <p>
    With a bit of luck, this library can evolve into something that
    makes it a lot easier to work with data stored within a LogStore,
    and we'll see third party applications making use of the storage
    format too - even if only as a source.
