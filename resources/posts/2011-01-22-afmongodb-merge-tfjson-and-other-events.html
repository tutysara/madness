    As of a few hours ago, the bigger part of
    my <a href="/projects/syslog-ng/mongodb/">afmongodb</a> driver has
    been merged to the
    official <a href="http://git.balabit.hu/?p=bazsi/syslog-ng-3.3.git;a=summary">syslog-ng
    3.3</a> tree!

  <p>
    A few things remain to be done, however:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      Authentication doesn't work. This is due to the underlying
      <a href="https://github.com/algernon/libmongo-client">client
      library</a> not supporting it yet. The code is still in the
      driver, commented out, and
      once <a href="https://github.com/algernon/libmongo-client">libmongo-client</a>
      gains authentication support, it can be re-enabled.
    </li>

    <li>
      Dynamic variable support. While this is one of the major selling
      points of the driver, this functionality will be added as a
      generic framework, which all drivers can use, if they wish
      to. The plan is to get the framework coded and merged, then the
      driver updated to support it.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Apart from the above two, of which, the second will be a tricky
    thing to implement, the driver is complete and as far as my tests
    show, stable.
  </p>

    In other news, starting this past week, I'll be working on
    <a href="http://www.balabit.com/network-security/syslog-ng/opensource-logging-system">syslog-ng
    OSE</a> during my work hours each friday. The first result is a
    port of Balint
    Kovacs' <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.syslog-ng/10521">JSON
    template formatting function</a>, but more work will follow.
