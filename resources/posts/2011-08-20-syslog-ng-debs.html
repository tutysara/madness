    <a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.sysutils.syslog-ng.announce/117">3.3.0beta2</a>
    has been released a couple of days ago, with a ton of fixes since
    beta1 - it's actually in such a good shape, that I will be
    deploying it everywhere where I'm not using it already.

    But for that to work smoothly, I needed Debian packages of it, and
    for squeeze, not only unstable. So I sat down early afternoon, and
    started hacking away, pretty much repackaging it from scratch,
    only borrowing very little from the official Debian packaging.
  </p>

  <p>
    The end result? I have a small build farm set up, which can build
    packages (and their dependencies, if so need be) for either stable
    or unstable, and place them in a neat repository:
  </p>

  <blockquote>
    <h2>Debian unstable</h2>
    <pre>deb      http://packages.madhouse-project.org/debian unstable syslog-ng
deb-src  http://packages.madhouse-project.org/debian unstable syslog-ng</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <blockquote>
    <h2>Debian stable</h2>
    <pre>deb      http://packages.madhouse-project.org/debian stable syslog-ng
deb-src  http://packages.madhouse-project.org/debian stable syslog-ng</pre>
  </blockquote>

  <p>
    While there's still a lot of work to be done with the packaging,
    it is good enough to deploy on a handful of hosts. I'll iron out
    the rest of the bugs during the coming week.
