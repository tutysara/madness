  <p>
    There's an ages old problem with the way Debian buildds build
    packages: they call the <em>build</em> target, which - by design -
    builds everything, be that architecture dependent or not.
  </p>

  <p>
    Many of us don't like that all that much, for different
    reasons. Fortunately, there are reasonable workarounds!
  </p>

<section>
  <p>
    There are at least three compelling reasons why one does not wish
    to build architecture-independent parts of a package when building
    on a buildd (and quite often, more than one reason applies):
  </p>

  <ol>
    <li>
      Building the arch-indep things takes a long time - and can
      potentially make the build time out.
    </li>
    <li>
      Building the arch-indep things needs sizable extra
      build-dependencies, that the arch-dependent build does
      not. Having to install an extra gigabyte of packages to build a
      set of API docs, that won't even be included in the upload is a
      wee-bit wasteful.
    </li>
    <li>
      Aesthetics. Because building useless things is a waste of
      everyone's time, slow buildds especially.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <p>
    Now, how do you get around the problem of buildds calling the
    <strong>build</strong>? We could wait and hope (or even send a patch,
    wish I had the time!) that the buildds will be updated to use the
    <strong>build-arch</strong> and <strong>build-indep</strong>
    targets, but those of us who need an immediate solution, can't do
    that.
  </p>

  <p>
    So we cheat. We cheat, by disabling the <strong>build</strong>
    target, turning it into a no-op: this is allowed by Policy, which
    reads:
  </p>

  <blockquote><p><i>The build target <strong>should</strong> perform
  all the configuration andcompilation of the
  package.</i></p></blockquote>

  <p>
    It's only a should, so it's safe to make it a no-op. We can then
    use the <strong>build-arch</strong>
    and <strong>build-indep</strong> targets, which will be depended
    upon by the <strong>binary-arch</strong>
    and <strong>binary-indep</strong> targets, and the buildds call
    only the former. When they do that, that will trigger the
    <strong>build-arch</strong> target too!
  </p>

  <p>
    And with that, we have a package that will only build arch-indep
    parts when it needs to.
  </p>

  <p>
    Depending on whether one uses <strong>dh</strong> short form, or a
    traditional <code>debian/rules</code>, here's an outline of how
    the rules file could look like:
  </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-make">build: ;
build-arch:
	# Do stuff to build arch-dependent stuff here
build-indep:
	# Do stuff to build arch-indep stuff here
binary-arch: build-arch
	# ...
binary-indep: build-indep
	# ...
binary: binary-arch binary-indep

.PHONY: build build-arch build-indep binary-arch binary-indep binary</pre>

  <p>
    With <strong>dh</strong> short form, this looks a bit different,
    because you don't need to set up dependencies, debhelper does that
    for us. We simply override the build: target, as per the above,
    and use the -arch and -indep variants of the <tt>dh_auto_*</tt>
    family of overrides. This can be either trivial, or complicated,
    depending on the build system.
  </p>

  <p>
    The basic idea is that we disable the <em>-indep</em> variant of
    those targets that we do not need, and leave the rest alone. If
    you need to override any of the other <tt>dh_auto_*</tt> stuff,
    override the <em>-arch</em> variant instead.
  </p>

  <p>
    This will result in a rules file that could look like this:
  </p>

  <pre class="prettyprint lang-make">build: ;

override_dh_auto_configure-arch:
	dh_auto_configure -- --my-special-param
override_dh_auto_build-arch:
	dh_auto_build

override_dh_auto_configure-indep: ;
override_dh_auto_test-indep: ;
override_dh_auto_install-indep: ;

override_dh_auto_build-indep:
	# Do stuff here to build arch-indep stuff, like
	# running doxygen.

%:
	dh $@</pre>

  <p>
    And that's about it! We now have a package that won't build
    arch-indep parts on buildds, so you can sleep peacefully that you
    could move huge build-dependencies
    to <em>Build-Depends-Indep</em>, that buildds won't spend time
    building docs and other data that they don't need to, and the
    solution isn't all that ugly, either!
  </p>

  <p>
    Even better, once buildds start using <em>build-arch</em>, these
    rules files will continue to work, and all that is needed to make
    them aesthetically pleasing is to make the <em>build:</em> target
    depend on <em>build-arch</em> and <em>build-indep</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The only downside of this workaround is that <code>debian/rules
    build</code> will not do the expected thing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Personally, I can live with that: in the vast majority of cases, I
    want to make a binary package, not just build the sources.
