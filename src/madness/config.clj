  The settings are as follows:

  * `:template` is a map of filenames to use as templates for various
    roles, such as: `:default`, `:atom`, and `:empty`.

    The first is a one-file template to use for the whole site. It
    should include all the bits and pieces needed to build the site.

    The second is the template for Atom feeds: the main feed and the
    per-tag feeds alike.

    The last one should be an almost empty HTML file, containing only
    an empty body element.

  * `:dirs`, the directories where the various parts of the sources
    are to be found.

  * `:recent-posts` and `:archived-posts` both have a `:columns` and a
    `:rows` setting, which determines how many columns and rows each
    will have. Setting `:rows` to 0 disables limiting.

  * `:atom` controls the `:base-url` and the `:title` of the generated
    Atom feeds."
