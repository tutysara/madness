  "## Loading & rendering of individual static pages

  For the sake of ease, static pages are fully loaded first, and
  turned into a structure that is easy to work with. This namespace
  implements the low-level loading, restructuring and rendering of
  individual static pages.

  Static pages are under `resources/pages` by default, and their path
  below that will be reused as-is for the URL of the generated
  page. That is, `resources/pages/foo/bar/index.html` becomes
  `/foo/bar/index.html`."

  Each static page must have an `article` element, where the only

  `comments` property, which, when set, will enable commenting on the
  particular page.

  Apart from the `article` element, only a `section` element is
  required, whose contents will be used as the main content of the
  static page.

  The structure this function generates, should be pretty clear by

;; ### Static page templates

;; The first thing about a page, is its header, the `h1` element of
;; the `hero-unit` in the template.
;;
;; This snippet uses that element as the title template, replacing the
;; `title` attribute of it, and its textual content with the title of
;; the page itself.
(h/defsnippet blog-page-title (cfg/template) [:.hero-unit :h1]
  [title]
  [:h1] (h/do->
         (h/content title)
         (h/set-attr :title title)))

;; If commenting is enabled for a post, the `#disqus` element should
;; be left intact, as-is. Otherwise, it will be removed, that is all
;; this snippet does.
(h/defsnippet blog-page-disqus (cfg/template) [:#disqus]
  [page]

  [:#disqus] (when (:comments page) identity))

;; #### Putting it all together
;;
;; To put a full page together, we alter the page title, disable the
;; recent and archived post areas, along with the `#post-neighbours`,
;; as pages do not have those. We also rearrange the `hero-unit`, and
;; last but not least, fill out the sidebar, using the tools provided
;; by [blog.nav][1].
