  "## Loading & rendering individual blog posts

  For the sake of ease, blog posts are fully loaded first, and turned
  into a structure that is easy to work with. This namespace
  implements the low-level loading, restructuring and rendering of
  individual blog posts.

  Blog posts are under `resources/posts` by default, and they all must
  have a filename that starts with a date (in YYYY-MM-DD format),
  followed by the short title of the post, that will be used for the
  URL."

  propery, which, when set, will enable commenting on the particular
  post.

  A blog post must also have a `summary` element, the contents of
  which will be used when rendering the post for the purposes of
  recent posts, or as the summary on the main index page. The summary
  is also part of the blog post, and when viewing the entire post, it
  will start with the summary.

  blog post will be displayed.

  glancing over the code here."

;; ### Blog post templates
;;
;; Blog posts are almost entirely contained within a `hero-unit`
;; class, with only the previous/next links outside of it.

;; One of the first things one sees about a post, is its title, which
;; is the `h1` element of the `hero-unit` in the template.
;;
;; This snippet uses that element as the title template, replacing the
;; `title` attribute of it, and its textual content with the title of
;; the post itself.
(h/defsnippet blog-post-title (cfg/template) [:.hero-unit :h1]
  [title]
  [:h1] (h/do->
         (h/content title)
         (h/set-attr :title title)))

;; #### Full article footer
;;
;; Posts, when viewed in full, and not only their summary, have a
;; footer, which holds their tags and the date they were posted on,
;; these all live under the `#full-article-footer` element.

;; The full article footer has only a single link in the template: the
;; snippet that we'll use to render a single tag.
(h/defsnippet blog-post-tag (cfg/template) [:#full-article-footer :a]
  [tag]

  [:a] (h/do->
        (h/set-attr :href (utils/tag-to-url tag))
        (h/after " "))
  [:a :span] (h/substitute tag))

;; The full footer contains a date, the `#post-date` element, and
;; we'll also render the tags there too. Both the `#post-date` and the
;; `#full-article-footer` ids will be removed.
(h/defsnippet blog-post-footer (cfg/template) [:#full-article-footer]
  [post]

  [:a] (h/clone-for [tag (:tags post)]
                    (h/substitute (blog-post-tag tag)))
  [:#post-date] (h/do->
                 (h/content (utils/date-format (:date post)))
                 (h/remove-attr :id))
  [:#full-article-footer] (h/remove-attr :id))

;; #### Post navigation
;;
;; To ease navigating between posts, previous and next posts (if
;; available) will be shown outside of the `hero-unit`. These we'll
;; call `#post-neighbours`, and this element must have two children:
;; one with a `pull-left` class (for the next post), and another with
;; `pull-right` (for the previous post).
;;
;; Both of these need to have an `a` element, whose `href` will be
;; rewritten, and that element must have a `span` child, to be
;; replaced by the title of the previous or next post.
;;
;; The `#post-neighbours` id will be removed from the final rendering,
;; as it is only used to easily identify the snippet within the full
;; template.
(h/defsnippet blog-post-neighbours (cfg/template) [:#post-neighbours]
  [neighbours]

  [:.pull-left :a :span] (h/substitute (:title (first neighbours)))
  [:.pull-left :a] (h/set-attr :href (:url (first neighbours)))
  [:.pull-left] (if (empty? (first neighbours))
                  nil
                  identity)
  
  [:.pull-right :a :span] (h/substitute (:title (last neighbours)))
  [:.pull-right :a] (h/set-attr :href (:url (last neighbours)))
  [:.pull-right] (if (empty? (last neighbours))
                   nil
                   identity)
  [:#post-neighbours] (h/remove-attr :id))

;; #### Commenting
;;
;; If commenting is enabled for a post, the `#disqus` element should
;; be left intact, as-is. Otherwise, it will be removed, that is all
;; this snippet does.
(h/defsnippet blog-post-disqus (cfg/template) [:#disqus]
  [post]

  [:#disqus] (when (:comments post) identity))

;; #### Putting it all together
;;
;; To put a full blog post together, we alter the page title, disable
;; the recent and archived post areas, rearrange the `hero-unit`, pull
;; in the next/prev links into `#post-neighbours`, and last but not
;; least, fill out the sidebar, using the tools provided by
;; [blog.nav][1].
