  "## Loading & rendering individual blog posts

  For the sake of ease, blog posts are fully loaded first, and turned
  into a structure that is easy to work with. This namespace
  implements the low-level loading, restructuring and rendering of
  individual blog posts.

  Blog posts are under `resources/posts` by default, and they all must
  have a filename that starts with a date (in YYYY-MM-DD format),
  followed by the short title of the post, that will be used for the
  URL."

  propery, which, when set, will enable commenting on the particular
  post.

  A blog post must also have a `summary` element, the contents of

  recent posts, or as the summary on the main index page. The summary
  is also part of the blog post, and when viewing the entire post, it
  will start with the summary.

  blog post will be displayed.

  The structure this function generates, should be pretty clear by
  glancing over the code here."

;; ### Blog post templates
;;
;; Blog posts are almost entirely contained within the
;; `#madness-article` element, with only the previous/next links
;; outside of it.

;; One of the first things one sees about a post, is its title, which
;; is the `h2` element of the `#madness-article` in the template.
;;
;; This snippet uses that element as the title template, replacing the
;; `title` attribute of it, and its textual content with the title of
;; the post itself.
(h/defsnippet blog-post-title (cfg/template) [:#madness-article :h2]
  [title]
  [:h2] (h/do->
         (h/content title)
         (h/set-attr :title title)))

;; #### Full article footer
;;
;; Posts, when viewed in full, and not only their summary, have a
;; footer, which holds their tags and the date they were posted on,
;; these all live under the `#madness-article-meta` element.

;; The full article footer has only a single link in the template: the
;; snippet that we'll use to render a single tag.
(h/defsnippet blog-post-tag (cfg/template) [:#madness-article-tags :a]
  [tag]

  [:a] (h/set-attr :href (utils/tag-to-url tag))
  [:a :span] (h/substitute tag))

;; The post meta-data - as mentioned just before - lives in
;; `#madness-article-meta`, and contains the date of the post, and the
;; tags. The tag list is passed in as an argument, separate from the
;; post.
(h/defsnippet blog-post-meta (cfg/template)

;; #### Post navigation
;;
;; To ease navigating between posts, previous and next posts (if
;; available) will be shown outside of the `#madness-article`. These
;; we'll call `#madness-article-neighbours`, and this element must
;; have two children:  `#madness-article-next` and
;; `#madness-article-prev` for links to the next and previous posts,
;; respectively.
;;
;; Both of these need to have an `a` element, whose `href` will be
;; rewritten, and that element must have a `span` child, to be
;; replaced by the title of the previous or next post.
;;

;; #### Commenting
;;
;; If commenting is enabled for a post, the
;; `#madness-article-comments` element should be left intact,
;; as-is. Otherwise, it will be removed, that is all this snippet
;; does.
(h/defsnippet blog-post-comments (cfg/template) [:#madness-article-comments]
  [post]

  [:#madness-article-comments] (when (:comments post) (h/remove-attr :id)))

;; A blog post title is contained within `#madness-article`, in a `h2`
;; element, which must have an `a` child. These two will be updated to
;; contain the title of the given blog post.

  [:h2] (h/set-attr :title (:title post))

;; #### Putting it all together
;;
;; To put a full blog post together, we alter the page title, disable
;; the recent and archived post areas, rearrange the
;; `#madness-article`, pull in the next/prev links into
;; `#post-neighbours`, and last but not least, fill out the global tag
;; & recent post lists, using the tools provided by [blog.nav][1].
;;
;; Tags that start with a dot will not be displayed along with the rest.
